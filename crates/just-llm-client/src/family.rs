//! Built-in backend family identifiers — the single source for family strings.
//!
//! Every backend is identified by its [`family`](crate::Identifiable::family): the stable
//! string used for error attribution, [`BackendFactory`](crate::BackendFactory) lookup, and
//! diagnostics. The constants here are the canonical values for the built-in backends, kept
//! in one place so application code references a named constant instead of a magic string.
//! Backends and the factory both read these constants, so the literal never drifts.
