//! - [`BackendConstructError`] — *constructing* a backend failed (`LlmBackend::new`,

//! - [`CapabilityError`] — a backend *statically* does not offer a capability
//!   (`CapabilityNegotiation`). Decided without IO; never a provider call.
//! - [`BackendError`] — *operating* an already-constructed backend failed (chat completion,
//!   streaming, prepare/send/parse, rendering, model catalog, balance). Runtime execution only.
