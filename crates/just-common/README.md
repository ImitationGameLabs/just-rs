# just-common

Shared HTTP transport, SSE stream parsing, and error types for the [just-agent] ecosystem.

[just-agent]: https://github.com/ImitationGameLabs/just-agent-libs

## Overview

This crate provides the internal building blocks used by the just-agent provider crates:

- **Authenticated HTTP transport** — reqwest-based transport construction with JSON helpers.
- **SSE stream parsing** — `JsonEventStream` for parsing server-sent event streams into typed JSON chunks.
- **Error types** — shared `TransportError` for protocol-level error handling.

> **Note:** This is an implementation dependency. You typically won't depend on it directly.
> Instead, use one of the crates below.
